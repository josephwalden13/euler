## Project Euler in C++

My solutions to the project euler problems without using any third party libraries. To run one type
> g++ problemX.cpp [extras] -o euler -std=c++0x && ./euler

into a terminal where X is any project number and extras = any from {"common.cpp", "bignumber.cpp"}

Anything inside the directory optimise works, but is too slow. My aim is under 1 second for each program, but anything over a minute is much too slow.
